# cmd-runner Ideas

This document contains experimental ideas and "nice-to-have" features that aren't
concrete enough for the ROADMAP yet. These are brainstorming notes for potential
future enhancements.

Feel free to discuss these ideas in GitHub issues!

See [../ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md) for planned features.

## Interactive Mode Enhancements

- Live search/filter as you type (fuzzy matching like fzf)
- Command history with up/down arrows in interactive mode
- Show command execution time after completion
- Color-coded output based on exit status
- Split pane view: menu on left, output on right
- Mouse support for clicking on commands
- Customizable shortcuts (user-defined key mappings)
- Show command frequency/usage statistics
- "Favorite" commands that always appear at top
- Command groups/categories that can be expanded/collapsed

## Smart Command Detection

- Auto-detect new commands when files change
- Learn from command history what variations user prefers
- Suggest commands based on recent file changes (e.g., "You modified tests, run test?")
- Detect command dependencies (e.g., "build before test")
- Warn when running commands in wrong directory
- Detect and suggest fixing common typos in typed commands

## Command Execution Features

- Parallel command execution with nice output merging
- Command queueing (queue up multiple commands to run sequentially)
- Background command execution with notification when complete
- Save command output to file automatically
- Pipe command output to other tools (grep, less, etc.)
- Macro recording: record a sequence of commands and replay
- Conditional execution based on previous command success/failure
- Time-based scheduling (run command at specific time or interval)

## Integration Ideas

- Shell prompt integration showing available commands
- Discord/Slack bot for running commands remotely
- Web UI for remote command execution
- Mobile app for monitoring long-running commands
- Integration with terminal multiplexers (tmux/screen)
- Git hooks integration (auto-run tests before commit)
- Detect and run git hooks from .git/hooks or .husky
- Detect and run GitHub Actions locally via act (nektos/act)
- CI/CD integration (export commands as GitHub Actions)

## AI/Smart Features

- Command suggestion based on context and history
- Auto-fix suggestions when commands fail
- Learn project-specific patterns and preferences
- Predict next command based on workflow patterns
- Generate command documentation from usage patterns

## Visualization

- Dependency graph of commands
- Execution timeline/history visualization
- Resource usage graphs (CPU, memory during execution)
- Success/failure rate charts
- Command relationship mapping
- Project health dashboard

## Quality of Life

- Undo last command (if we are using jj or autocommit)
- Dry-run mode to preview what would be executed
- Command aliasing at runtime (not just in config)
- Bookmark specific command combinations
- Export/import command configurations between projects
- Command templates with variable substitution
- Auto-update notification for cmd-runner itself
- Contextual help based on current project type

## Performance & Optimization

- Predictive command pre-loading
- Distributed execution across multiple machines
- Caching of command outputs for fast re-display
- Incremental execution (only run what changed)
- Smart test selection based on code changes
- Resource-aware execution (delay if system busy)

## Windows/Cross-Platform Support

### .NET Development
- dotnet CLI support
- MSBuild detection
- NuGet package management
- Visual Studio project detection

### Windows-Specific Features
- PowerShell completion support
- Windows Terminal integration
- cmd.exe batch file support
- Cross-platform terminal compatibility

## Command History and Intelligence

- Track frequently used commands
- Suggest recent commands
- Per-project command history
- Smart command suggestions based on context

## Configuration System

### Project Configuration
- `.cmdrunner.yml` or `.cmdrunner.toml` for project-specific settings
- Custom command aliases
- Command chains/sequences
- Environment-specific commands

### Global Configuration
- User preferences (~/.config/cmdrunner/)
- Custom command templates
- Default flags for commands

## Advanced Features

### Parallel Execution
- Run multiple commands concurrently
- Command dependencies and ordering
- Output aggregation

### Command Composition
- Chain commands with operators (&&, ||, ;)
- Pipe output between commands
- Conditional execution

### Environment Management
- Automatic environment variable loading (.env files)
- Environment-specific command variants
- Virtual environment activation

## Enhanced Command Discovery

### Smart Pattern Matching
- Detect common script patterns across different tools
- Support for tool-specific conventions (e.g., "build:prod" vs "build-prod")
- Context-aware command selection based on project type

### Custom Script Parsing
- Parse pyproject.toml [tool.scripts] sections
- Parse Makefile includes and recursive makefiles
- Support for Taskfile.yml (Task runner)
- Parse Gradle/Maven custom tasks

## Enhanced Script Discovery

- Script metadata from package files
- Custom script descriptions
- Script dependencies and relationships
- Hidden/internal script filtering
- Priority ordering for common scripts

## Notes

These ideas range from practical to playful. Not all may align with cmd-runner's
philosophy of simplicity. This list serves as a creative parking lot for features
that might inspire future development or spark community contributions.

Feel free to discuss these ideas in GitHub issues!
